Title: About
Slug: about

I'm a seasoned software engineer with 10+ years experience developing web apps, services, various APIs and workplace automation.

My current tech stack includes (but is not limited to) Python, Django, Docker, Git, Ansible, and more. I can also handle JavaScript, HTML and CSS pretty well, and in my free time I like to explore interesting projects like Rust or Elixir.
