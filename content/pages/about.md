Title: About me
Slug: about

I'm a seasoned software engineer with 15 years experience designing and developing web apps and APIs in the context of service oriented architectures, test and deployment automation, CI/CD and data pipelines, and more.

My current stack includes (but is not limited to) Python, Docker, Git, Ansible and (virtual) whiteboards. In my free time I like to explore interesting projects like Rust or Go.

Companies I've worked with in the past include [Activision-Blizzard](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/) and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/).
