Title: About me
Slug: about

I'm a seasoned software engineer with 15+ years experience developing web apps, services, various APIs and workplace automation.

My current tech stack includes (but is not limited to) Python, Django, Docker, Git, Ansible, and more. I can also handle JavaScript, HTML and CSS pretty well, and in my free time I like to explore interesting projects like Rust or Elixir.

Companies I've worked with in the past include [Activision-Blizzard](https://www.activisionblizzard.com/) and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/).
